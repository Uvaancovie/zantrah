MVP Feedback 09/07/25

1. UI & Navigation Structure (High Priority)
Problem: Navigation lacks hierarchy and structure. There's no visual distinction or flow between
core features.
Expected Fix: Introduce a section-based homepage layout, with cards, icons, or blocks for the
following:
- Shop Products (E-commerce)
- Hire Freelancers
- Trade Talents Directory (Business Networking)
- Learn and Earn (Micro-courses / EdTech)
- B2B, B2C, C2C filter tabs or buttons (click to refine experience)
Use visuals tiles or illustrated buttons to guide users into each experience layer. Add a fixed
navbar or side menu that follows the user throughout the journey.
2. Ambience & Immersion
Currently: Clean, minimal interface with navigation links and placeholders. No visual depth or
sense of "place".
POV: Let's aim for a Sim-like digital city, with expressive storefronts. The current UI feels
static and disconnected from the immersive marketplace we envisioned.
3. User Onboarding: Sign-Up, Login, Roles (Urgent)
"Users must know who they are and what they can do on Zantrah."
Add structured sign-up pathways:
- Buyer / Seller
- Freelancer / Client
- Producer / Distributor
- Learner / Educator
- Add a basic dashboard for each role after login.
- Include ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù walkthrough or ‚Äú3 steps to join the Zantrah economy‚Äù.

4. Homepage Call to Action
"The homepage should sell the platform instantly."
Add a clear tagline and mission statement:
- example: "Buy. Sell. Hire. Learn. The Digital Marketplace for Africa." (Ask me
for tagline)

Make "Get Started" or "Explore the Marketplace" highly visible
Add 4 core blocks to represent the ecosystem:
- Work üíº
- Products üõç
- Network ü§ù
- Learn üéì

FEEDBACK: Sign-Up & Vendor Verification

Current Issue (Articulated Clearly)
‚¶Å Visually Insecure: The sign-up form looks plain and doesn‚Äôt signal trust or
professional-grade encryption.
‚¶Å No User Types or Roles: There‚Äôs no clear distinction between signing up as a buyer,
freelancer, vendor, or student.
‚¶Å No Verification Flow: Vendors and service providers can enter the platform without
validation ‚Äî damaging credibility.
‚¶Å Missing UX Indicators of Security: No lock icon, encryption message, or CAPTCHA =
perceived vulnerability.
‚¶Å Lacks Emotional Design: There‚Äôs no warmth, guidance, or reassurance during the onboarding
process.

What Needs to Be Added or Improved
1. Professional, Structured Sign-Up Flow
Include visual elements and multiple steps to improve trust:
Start with a role selector screen:
‚ÄúI want to: Buy Products | Sell Products | Hire Freelancers | Offer Services | Learn New Skills‚Äù
Show logos of payment partners and security standards (SSL Secured, etc.)
Add password strength meter, CAPTCHA, and security tips

2. Vendor Verification Process
Implement a 3-tier trust system for vendors and freelancers:
| Level | Requirements | Badge |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |

| Basic | Email + phone verified | Verified User | üü°
| Pro | Upload ID + Business Reg + Portfolio | Verified Seller | üü¢
| Elite | Manual review, referrals, proof of delivery history | Trusted Vendor | üîµ

Users should see this badge on every seller profile and shop card.
